**coordinates** is [a p5.js sketch](https://p5js.org/). It currently uses
v1.2.0 of [the p5.js library](https://github.com/processing/p5.js).

It also uses:

- [KEYS.css](https://github.com/michaelhue/keyscss) 1.1 by Michael HÃ¼neburg
- [*Fork me on GitHub* CSS
  ribbon](https://github.com/simonwhitaker/github-fork-ribbon-css) 0.2.3 by
  Simon Whitaker
- [Red Hat Display and Red Hat
  Text](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont) (fonts)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (font)

## How to use

The code in this repository is usually the same code as [hosted in the p5js web
editor](https://editor.p5js.org/Eliah/sketches/MAJ8qCEc). You can use it there,
or on [this other page, hosted on GitHub
Pages](https://eliahkagan.github.io/coordinates/).

You can also clone or otherwise download the contents of this repository and
access it locally in a web browser (double-click `index.html`).

On `index.html`, below the interactive canvas, there are instructions
describing the controls.

## Known bugs

Accessibility would be improved if the dot could be moved on the canvas, and
&ldquo;picked up&rdquo; and &ldquo;put down,&rdquo; using keyboard input (e.g.,
arrow keys) as an alternative to a pointing device such as a mouse. But that is
not currently implemented. As an (admittedly lackluster) workaround, you may be
able to use [sticky keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_keys).

Use on mobile devices is unlikely to work at all. It is not supported at this
time.

## A note on dependencies

You won&rsquo;t find the source code of those dependencies in this repository,
because they are retrieved via
[CDNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) when you load
the page.

Please note also that while this project is in the public domain, those
dependencies are not (though, like this project, they are all free software):

If you just want to use this software, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about any
of that. Your web browser fetches the dependencies automatically, so long as
you are connected to the internet.
